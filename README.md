Hi, I just have a few things to suggest...
1. Add a readme file. It really helps new and curious developers know what they're looking at if they visit your code.
2. Some upgrades seem to cost slightly more than displayed, though as I have experienced this before, the most likely problem is that you've put a > sign instead of a >= sign, I can't be bothered to actually check if this is right.
3. Make sure that every purchase had a document.getElementById(<i>"element name"</i>).innerHTML=<i>"var name"</i>. I noticed that some purchases didn't update the counter.
4. Do some work on balancing. It may seem like an annoying chore, but really make sure the prices put it off until just before someone gets bored, so they get the most play time possible out of your game.

Other than that, it seems like a good concept for a game. I don't really have too much experience as I've only been using HTML and JavaScript for a few months now, but I have used other platforms to make games. If you wanted to check out my rubbish game its at quasiconnective.github.io/QuantumFlux. Trust me, it's rubbish.
Anyway, hopefully you see this.
    Thanks
